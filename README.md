# Building LLM Apps...without OpenAI 
Want to build LLM Apps...but without OpenAI dependencies? Well have I got the code for you my friend. In this project I walk through how to build a langchain x streamlit app using GPT4All. We start off with a simple app and then build up to a langchain PythonREPL agent.

# Startup 🚀
1. Create a virtual environment `python -m venv nonopenai`
2. Activate it: 
   - Windows:`.\nonopenai\Scripts\activate`
   - Mac: `source nonopenai/bin/activate`
3. Install the GPT4All Installer using GUI based installers
   - Windows: https://gpt4all.io/installers/gpt4all-installer-win64.exe 
   - Mac: https://gpt4all.io/installers/gpt4all-installer-darwin.dmg
   - Ubuntu: https://gpt4all.io/installers/gpt4all-installer-linux.run
4. Download the required LLM models and take note of the PATH they're installed to
5. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/nicknochnack/Nopenai`
6. Go into the directory `cd Nopenai`
7. Install the required dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
8. Update the path of the models in line 9 of `app.py` and line 5 of `app-chain.py`
9.  Start the python agent app by running `streamlit run app.py` or the chain app by running `streamlit run app-chain.py`  
10. Go back to my YouTube channel and like and subscribe 😉...no seriously...please! lol 
11. The comparison app can be started by running `streamlit run app-comparison.py` before you do that though, update the base ggml download path in line 16, e.g. `BASE_PATH = 'C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/nomic.ai/GPT4All/'` and openAI api key on line 18
